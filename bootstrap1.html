                <p>Blues developed in the 19th century and was originally played by a single performer singing with a guitar or banjo. By the 1960s, The Blues had evolved significantly along with the instruments used (now electric guitars, bass and drums) and made its way across the Atlantic to the UK and beyond.

    			<p>Classical music is best represented  by  famous composers like Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart.
                <br>To many people, anything pre-jazz sounds classical and may be referred to as such. Once you get inside this genre, however, you will find whole world music and a stunning range of styles and categories</p>

            	<p>With roots in rock, pop, heavy metal and punk, emo music has a specific goal in that it is designed to have a particularly emotive or emotional resonance.
                <br>Characterised by expressive melodic musicianship and often confessional lyrics. It is often associated with a particular fashion style that is also influenced by metal and punk</p>

            	<h2>Grime</h2>
            	<p>Grime is a genre of electronic music that emerged in London in the early 2000s. It developed out of the earlier UK dance style UK garage, and draws influences from jungle, dancehall, and hip hop. The style is typified by rapid, syncopated breakbeats, generally around 140 beats per minute, and often features an aggressive or jagged electronic sound. Emceeing is a significant element of the style, and lyrics often revolve around gritty depictions of urban life.</p>

	        	<h2>What is the number one genre of music?</h2>
	        	<p>While hip-hop and rap music have taken over the charts recently, Pop music is still the ‘most heard’ of all music genres. What’s incredibly interesting about music is that both geography and culture play a huge role in the popularity of music. Your own home town probably has its own music scene where one type of music is more prevalent.</p>

				<h4>Social influences on music selection:</h4>
				<p>Since music has become more easily accessible (Spotify, iTunes, YouTube, etc.), more people have begun listening to a broader and wider range of music styles. In addition, social identity also plays a large role in music preference. Personality is a key contributor for music selection. Those who consider themselves to be "rebels" will tend to choose heavier music styles like heavy metal or hard rock, while those who consider themselves to be more "relaxed" or "laid back" will tend to choose lighter music styles like jazz or classical music. According to one model, there are five main factors that exist that underlie music preferences that are genre-free,[contradictory] and reflect emotional/affective responses.</p>
